\description{
Manage installed OpenCPU applications. These applications can be started locally
using \link{ocpu_start_app} or deployed online on \href{https://ocpu.io}{ocpu.io}.
}
\details{
OpenCPU apps are simply R packages. For regular users, apps get installed in a
user-specific app library which is persistent between R sessions. This is used
for locally running or developing web applications.

When running these functions as \code{opencpu} user on an OpenCPU cloud server, apps
will be installed in the global opencpu server app library; the same library as used
by the OpenCPU Github webhook.
